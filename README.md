## 📐 A Backend System Redesign Series
Inspired by how designers practice by redesign the product, I started a System Redesign Series, where I analyze and reimagine the backend architecture of real-world services.

## 🛠 Small but Impactful Tools
I love solving real-world problems, no matter how small, by building simple yet effective tools.  
Here are some projects where I helped people overcome digital limitations:

### 📌 Pinterest GIF Backup Downloader
* Problem: Pinterest discontinued GIF support, leaving users struggling to manually back up their GIFs.  
* Solution: Forked the [py3-pinterest](https://github.com/bstoilov/py3-pinterest) repository and created a script to bulk-download GIFs, packaging it as an executable (`.exe`) for easy use.  
* Impact: Reduced backup time from several days to under an hour, helping many users reclaim their content.  

### 📌 X (Twitter) Thread Backup Tool
* Problem: Many users write long threads on X (formerly Twitter) and wanted a way to back them up.  
* Solution: Forked the [twitter-archive-parser](https://github.com/timhutton/twitter-archive-parser) repository and built a script that automatically extracts and saves full thread content.  
* Enhancement: Later evolved this into a [backend-free browser tool](https://gayuna.github.io/tweet-processor/), leveraging client-side computing to process backups.  
* Project Write-up: [Read more here](https://gayuna.github.io/llm/thread-backup/) (Note: Written in Korean)
