## 💡 What I Bring to the Table
**AI & LLM-Powered Solutions:**
* *Engineered South Korea's first AI-based homework feedback system from concept to deployment*, driving *98% user satisfaction* by automating manual grading and providing personalized student insights.
• Passionate about applying cutting-edge LLM technologies to solve real-world problems.

**Strategic Global E-Commerce Integration:**
* Key contributor to Coupang's Taiwan market entry, leading backend integrations that resulted in an *8000% revenue surge* (from $128K to $8M in 1.5 years).
* Expert in navigating diverse technical environments and complex partner relationships to enable large-scale business expansion.

**Innovative Algorithm Development & Problem Solving:**

**Robust & Cost-Efficient Cloud Infrastructure:**
* Achieved *25-33% cloud cost reduction* through meticulous JVM tuning and effective resource scaling, ensuring operational efficiency.

## 🌱 Building Communities from Scratch
I believe that great communities are built when people with shared goals come together to solve common problems. I actively seek out these opportunities, taking the initiative to build platforms and groups that foster connection and growth.

#### Organizer | BAKG Study Club++
As professionals advance in their careers, finding dedicated study partners becomes a significant challenge. To solve this, I joined as a board member to operate BAKG, a study club for Korean IT professionals.

* What I do: I recruit and onboard new study members, facilitate kick-off meetings, organize offline networking events, and actively participate in studies myself.
* Impact: We've created a valuable hub for motivated professionals to connect, learn together, and grow their networks. This experience has been fundamental in developing my leadership and community management skills.

#### Founder & Tech Lead | Holidap Project
Working Holiday information is often scattered and outdated. I saw an opportunity to create a centralized platform to address this.

* The Project: I am leading a team of five (2 Frontend, 2 Data, and myself as Backend/Lead) to build Holidap, a platform for sharing the latest Working Holiday information for Canada.
* My Vision: The goal is to grow Holidap into a global community—first for anyone coming to Canada, and eventually for anyone from glob who coming to Canada on a Working Holiday visa.
* What I'm Learning: Leading a multidisciplinary team from concept to launch is teaching me invaluable lessons in project management, team collaboration, and turning a vision into a tangible product.

## 📐 A Backend System Redesign Series
Inspired by how designers practice by redesign the product, I started a System Redesign Series, where I analyze and reimagine the backend architecture of real-world services.

## 🛠 Small but Impactful Tools
I love solving real-world problems, no matter how small, by building simple yet effective tools.  
Here are some projects where I helped people overcome digital limitations:

#### 📌 Pinterest GIF Backup Downloader
* Problem: Pinterest discontinued GIF support, leaving users struggling to manually back up their GIFs.  
* Solution: Forked the [py3-pinterest](https://github.com/bstoilov/py3-pinterest) repository and created a script to bulk-download GIFs, packaging it as an executable (`.exe`) for easy use.  
* Impact: Reduced backup time from several days to under an hour, helping many users reclaim their content.  

#### 📌 X (Twitter) Thread Backup Tool
* Problem: Many users write long threads on X (formerly Twitter) and wanted a way to back them up.  
* Solution: Forked the [twitter-archive-parser](https://github.com/timhutton/twitter-archive-parser) repository and built a script that automatically extracts and saves full thread content.  
* Enhancement: Later evolved this into a [backend-free browser tool](https://gayuna.github.io/tweet-processor/), leveraging client-side computing to process backups.  
* Project Write-up: [Read more here](https://gayuna.github.io/llm/thread-backup/) (Note: Written in Korean)
